# kolamNET
KolamNET is a web-based tool for analyzing, regenerating, and creating Kolam art designs. It combines deep learning models for style transfer with an interactive interface that allows users to upload images, select regions for regeneration, draw custom kolams on a dot board, and capture new designs via camera for symmetry and geometry analysis.
